    "## Pauli-Power Gates\n",
    "The **Pauli-power gates** ($X^t$, $Y^t$, $Z^t$) are introduced to circumvent the ambiguity that arises when defining non-integer powers of matrices. They are defined not by directly taking the $t$-th power of a Pauli matrix, but through a relationship with the Pauli-rotation gates ($R_x$, $R_y$, $R_z$).\n",
    "\n",
    "This representation is computationally advantageous because the desired rotation angles in quantum computing are often simple binary fractions ($\\pm \\pi/2^n$), which have exact floating-point representations, avoiding numerical round-off errors associated with $\\pi$.\n",
